## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL database
- Google Cloud Storage account (optional, falls back to local storage)
- OpenAI API key

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-recruiter-pro.git
   cd ai-recruiter-pro
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For exact versions
   # OR
   pip install -r requirements-app.txt  # For minimum versions
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   python migrations.py
   ```

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for a complete list of configuration options. The most important ones are:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL database connection string |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key for AI features |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Path to GCP service account credentials file |
| `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` | Google Cloud Storage bucket name for resume storage |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Secret key for session encryption |
| `DEMO_PASSWORD` | Password for the demo admin account (improves security) |

## üîí Google Cloud Storage Setup

This application can use Google Cloud Storage to store candidate resumes, making them accessible from anywhere and reducing local storage needs:

1. Create a Google Cloud Project
2. Create a service account with Storage Admin permissions
3. Download the service account credentials JSON file
4. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of this file
5. Create a bucket and set the `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable

The application will automatically fall back to local storage if GCS credentials are not provided.

## üìã Admin Guide

### Initial Setup

After installation, create an admin account:
```bash
python create_admin.py --email admin@example.com --password SecurePassword123
```

### Adding Sample Data

You can add sample data to test the application:
```bash
python add_test_data.py
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- Store the Google Cloud credentials file securely
- Regularly rotate your API keys and credentials
- Use strong passwords for database and admin accounts
- Always set the `DEMO_PASSWORD` environment variable to a secure value
- Never expose login credentials in UI elements or public-facing pages
- Set up proper HTTPS in production

### Role-Based Access Control System

The application implements a three-tier role hierarchy:

- **Administrator**: Full system access with user management capabilities
- **Senior Recruiter**: Enhanced permissions for team management, with ability to invite users and share data
- **Recruiter**: Standard permissions for candidate and job management

Each role has specific permissions:

| Feature | Recruiter | Senior Recruiter | Administrator |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| View Candidates | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Rate Candidates | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Manage Jobs | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Bulk Upload | ‚úó | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Invite Users | ‚úó | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Manage Teams | ‚úó | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| System Config | ‚úó | ‚úó | ‚úì |
| Data Analytics | ‚úó | ‚úì | ‚úì |

### Demo Admin Account Security

The application uses a special security mechanism for the demo admin account:

- The password for the demo admin account (`demo@example.com`) is controlled by the `DEMO_PASSWORD` environment variable
- This variable is loaded from the `.env` file at startup
- The application automatically synchronizes the demo account password with this environment variable
- Regular user accounts (non-demo) continue to use standard password management
- This approach ensures that demo credentials can be centrally managed without hardcoding 
- The demo account password is automatically reset to match the environment variable upon application startup

## üöÄ Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set `FLASK_ENV=production` and `DEBUG=False`
2. Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
   ```
3. Set up proper HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
4. Configure database connection pooling
5. Consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx
